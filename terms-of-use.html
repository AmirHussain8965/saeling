                <p><b>Dispute Resolution.</b> It is hoped that should we ever have any differences, we could be able to work them out amiably through e-mail correspondence.

You understand and agree now that the only remedy that can be awarded to you through arbitration is full refund of your Payment made to date. No other actions or financial awards of consequential damages, or any other type of damages, may be granted to you. We both agree now that the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding, and may be entered as a judgment into any court having the appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
                <p><b>By purchasing our Programs, Products, Site, Subscriptions, Services and Program Materials you are agreeing to a modification of the statute of limitations such that any arbitration must be begun within one (1) year of the date of your e-mail to me referenced above or you waive the right to seek dispute resolution by arbitration or to take any other legal action.</b></p>
                <p>You also agree that should arbitration take place, it will be held in in the State of Delaware where my business is registered, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to all reasonable attorneys’ fees and all costs necessary to enforce the decision of the arbitrator.</p>
                <p>In the event of a dispute between us, you agree to not engage in any conduct or communications, including on social media, designed to disparage us, our Company, or any of our Programs, Products, Site, Subscriptions, Services and Program Materials. Where requested by law or arbitration, of course, you are not prohibited from sharing your thoughts and opinions as a part of the legal process</p>
                <p>If any terms of these Terms of Use are construed to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other term which shall be given full force and effect.</p>
                <p><b>Governing Law.</b> These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware where my business is registered, regardless of the conflict of laws principles.</p>
